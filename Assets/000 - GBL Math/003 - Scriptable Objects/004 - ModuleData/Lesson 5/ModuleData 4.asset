  LeftPageText: '11. Power of a Test:


    The power of a statistical test is the
    probability of correctly rejecting the null hypothesis when it is false. It depends
    on the sample size, effect size, significance level, and variability in the data.

    


    12.
    One-Sample t-test:


    The one-sample t-test is used to determine if a sample
    mean significantly differs from a hypothesized population mean. It assumes that
    the data are normally distributed and that the population standard deviation
    is unknown.

'
  RightPageText: '13. Two-Sample t-test:


    The two-sample t-test is used to
    compare the means of two independent samples and determine if there is a significant
    difference between them. It assumes that the data are normally distributed and
    that the populations have equal variances.

    


    14. Paired t-test:


    The
    paired t-test is used to compare the means of two related samples, such as before-and-after
    measurements on the same individuals. It assesses if there is a significant difference
    in the means.
