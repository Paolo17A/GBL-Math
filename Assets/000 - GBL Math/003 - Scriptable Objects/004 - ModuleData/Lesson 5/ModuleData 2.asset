  LeftPageText: '3. Sampling Bias:


    Sampling bias occurs when the sample selected
    does not accurately represent the population, leading to misleading results.
    It is crucial to minimize bias to ensure the validity of statistical analyses.

    


    4.
    Sampling Distribution:


    A sampling distribution is the distribution of
    a statistic, such as the mean or proportion, based on multiple samples taken
    from the same population. It provides insights into the behavior of the statistic
    and allows for making inferences about the population.

'
  RightPageText: "5. Central Limit Theorem:\r\n\nThe Central Limit Theorem states
    that the sampling distribution of the mean approaches a normal distribution as
    the sample size increases, regardless of the shape of the population distribution.
    This property is essential for statistical inference.\r\n\r\n\n6. Standard Error:\r\n\nThe
    standard error is a measure of the variability of the sample statistic. It quantifies
    the average difference between the sample statistic and the population parameter.\r"
