  LeftPageText: '15. Activity: Hypothesis Testing with Samples


    In this activity,
    you will practice conducting hypothesis tests using different t-tests based on
    provided sample data, hypotheses, and significance levels.

    


    16.
    Nonparametric Tests:


    Nonparametric tests are used when data do not meet
    the assumptions required for parametric tests. These tests, such as the Mann-Whitney
    U test and Wilcoxon signed-rank test, rely on ranks rather than specific distributional
    assumptions.

  RightPageText: '17. Summary:


    Sampling and sampling distributions are essential
    components of statistical analysis. By understanding different sampling methods,
    sampling distributions, hypothesis testing, and confidence intervals, you gain
    powerful tools for drawing meaningful conclusions from sample data.

    


    Congratulations
    on completing this module! Sampling is a crucial step in statistical analysis,
    and now you have the knowledge to select representative samples and make accurate
    inferences. Keep up the great work, and let''s continue our statistical journey!
