  LeftPageText: "Welcome to Lesson 5 of the Introduction to Statistics course! In
    this module, we will explore the concepts of sampling and sampling distributions.
    \n\nSampling is the process of selecting a subset of individuals or observations
    from a larger population. Understanding sampling methods and sampling distributions
    is crucial for making accurate inferences about populations based on sample data.
    Let's dive into the world of sampling!\r\n\r\n\n1. Introduction to Sampling:\r\n\nSampling
    is the process of selecting a subset of individuals or observations from a larger
    population. It is essential to choose a representative sample to make valid inferences
    about the population.\r\n"
  RightPageText: '2. Types of Sampling Methods:


    a. Simple Random Sampling:
    Each member of the population has an equal chance of being selected.


    b.
    Stratified Sampling: The population is divided into subgroups, and a random sample
    is taken from each subgroup.


    c. Cluster Sampling: The population is divided
    into clusters, and a random sample of clusters is selected.


    d. Systematic
    Sampling: Every nth individual is selected from the population after an initial
    random start.


    e. Convenience Sampling: Individuals are chosen based on
    their availability or accessibility.
