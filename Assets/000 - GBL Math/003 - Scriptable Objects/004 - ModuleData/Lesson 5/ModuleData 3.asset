  LeftPageText: "7. Confidence Intervals for Means:\r\n\nConfidence intervals provide
    a range of values within which the population mean is estimated to lie with a
    certain level of confidence. The formula for a confidence interval depends on
    the sample size, standard deviation, and desired level of confidence.\r\n\r\n\n8.
    Sample Size Determination:\r\n\nDetermining the sample size is crucial to ensure
    that the sample provides reliable results. Factors to consider include the desired
    level of confidence, margin of error, population variability, and research objectives.\r"
  RightPageText: '9. Hypothesis Testing with Samples:


    Hypothesis testing is
    used to make inferences about population parameters based on sample data. The
    process involves formulating null and alternative hypotheses, selecting a significance
    level, performing statistical tests, and drawing conclusions.

    


    10.
    Type I and Type II Errors:


    Type I error occurs when we reject the null
    hypothesis when it is true. Type II error occurs when we fail to reject the null
    hypothesis when it is false. Understanding these errors helps assess the accuracy
    of hypothesis testing results.
