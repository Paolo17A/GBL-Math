  LeftPageText: "13. The Law of Large Numbers:\r\n\nThe Law of Large Numbers states
    that as the number of trials or experiments increases, the experimental probability
    of an event approaches its theoretical probability.\r\n\r\n\n14. Random Variables:\r\n\nRandom
    variables are variables that take on different values based on the outcome of
    a random experiment. They can be discrete or continuous.\n\n15. Probability Density
    Functions:\r\n\nProbability density functions (PDFs) describe the probabilities
    of different values occurring in a continuous random variable. The area under
    the curve of a PDF represents the probability of a range of values.\r"
  RightPageText: "16. Cumulative Distribution Functions:\r\n\nCumulative distribution
    functions (CDFs) give the probability that a random variable is less than or
    equal to a specified value. It provides a cumulative view of the probabilities.\r\n\r\n\n17.
    Confidence Intervals:\r\n\nConfidence intervals provide a range of values within
    which an unknown population parameter is estimated to lie with a certain level
    of confidence. They take into account the variability in the data and the sample
    size.\r\n\n\n18. Hypothesis Testing:\r\n\nHypothesis testing is a statistical
    procedure used to make inferences and test assumptions about population parameters
    based on sample data.\r"
