  LeftPageText: "9. Conditional Probability:\r\n\nConditional probability is the
    probability of an event occurring given that another event has already occurred.
    It is calculated by dividing the probability of the intersection of the two events
    by the probability of the condition event.\r\n\r\n\n10. Permutations and Combinations:\r\n\nPermutations
    and combinations are techniques used to count and calculate the number of possible
    arrangements or selections of items from a set.\r"
  RightPageText: "11. Probability Distributions:\r\n\nProbability distributions describe
    the likelihood of different outcomes in a random experiment. Common probability
    distributions include the binomial distribution, the normal distribution, and
    the Poisson distribution.\r\n\r\n\n12. Expected Value:\r\n\nThe expected value,
    also known as the mean or average value, is a measure of the long-term average
    outcome of a random experiment. It is calculated by multiplying each possible
    outcome by its corresponding probability and summing them.\r"
