  LeftPageText: "Welcome to Lesson 4 of the Introduction to Statistics course! In
    this module, we will explore the fundamental concepts of probability.\n\nProbability
    is a branch of mathematics that deals with uncertainty and the likelihood of
    events occurring. Understanding probability is essential for making informed
    decisions based on data and statistical analysis. Let's dive into the world of
    probability!\r\n\r\n\n1. What is Probability?\r\n\nProbability is the measure
    of the likelihood of an event occurring. It quantifies the uncertainty associated
    with an event and is expressed as a value between 0 and 1, where 0 represents
    impossibility, and 1 represents certainty.\r"
  RightPageText: "2. Sample Spaces and Events:\r\nA sample space is the set of all
    possible outcomes of an experiment, and an event is a specific outcome or a collection
    of outcomes within the sample space. Events can be simple (single outcome) or
    compound (combination of outcomes).\r\n\r\n3. Theoretical Probability:\r\nTheoretical
    probability is based on the assumption of equally likely outcomes. It is calculated
    by dividing the number of favorable outcomes by the total number of possible
    outcomes.\r\n\r\n4. Experimental Probability:\r\nExperimental probability is
    determined through direct observation or experimentation. It is calculated by
    dividing the number of times an event occurs by the total number of trials or
    experiments conducted.\r"
