  LeftPageText: '5. Independent and Dependent Events:


    Independent events are
    events where the occurrence of one event does not affect the probability of the
    other event. Dependent events are events where the occurrence of one event affects
    the probability of the other event.

    


    6. Complementary Events:


    The
    complement of an event is the event that does not occur. The probability of the
    complement of an event can be found by subtracting the probability of the event
    from 1.

  RightPageText: "7. Addition Rule:\r\n\nThe addition rule is used to find the probability
    of the union of two or more events. It states that the probability of the occurrence
    of either of two mutually exclusive events is the sum of their individual probabilities.\r\n\r\n\n8.
    Multiplication Rule:\r\n\nThe multiplication rule is used to find the probability
    of the intersection of two or more independent events. It states that the probability
    of the occurrence of both events is the product of their individual probabilities.\r"
