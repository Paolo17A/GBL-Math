  LeftPageText: 'a. Range: The difference between the maximum and minimum values
    in a dataset.


    b. Variance: The average of squared differences between
    each data point and the mean.


    c. Standard Deviation: The square root of
    the variance, providing a measure of the average distance between data points
    and the mean.

    


    4. Frequency Distributions:

    Frequency distributions
    display the number of times each value occurs in a dataset. They can be presented
    in tables, histograms, or bar charts to visualize the distribution patterns.

  RightPageText: '5. Graphical Representations:

    Graphical representations,
    such as histograms, box plots, and scatter plots, help us visualize and understand
    the data. They provide insights into patterns, outliers, and relationships within
    the dataset.

    

    6. Measures of Position:

    Measures of position,
    such as percentiles and quartiles, divide the dataset into specific intervals
    to determine the relative position of a value within the dataset.


    7. Interpreting
    Descriptive Statistics:

    Understanding and interpreting descriptive statistics
    is crucial for making meaningful conclusions about data. Consider the context
    of the dataset, the measures of central tendency, variability, and graphical
    representations to draw appropriate conclusions.
