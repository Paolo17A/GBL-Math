  LeftPageText: "Welcome to Lesson 3 of the Introduction to Statistics course! In
    this module, we will delve into descriptive statistics, which involves summarizing
    and describing data in meaningful ways. \n\nDescriptive statistics help us understand
    the main characteristics of a dataset and provide a foundation for further statistical
    analysis. Let's get started!\r\n\r\n\n1. What is Descriptive Statistics?\r\n\nDescriptive
    statistics involves organizing, summarizing, and presenting data in a way that
    allows us to understand its main features. It focuses on measures of central
    tendency, variability, and distribution of the data.\r\n"
  RightPageText: "2. Measures of Central Tendency:\r\n\n\nMeasures of central tendency
    help us identify the typical or central value in a dataset. The three common
    measures are:\r\n\r\na. Mean: The arithmetic average of all values in a dataset.\r\n\nb.
    Median: The middle value that separates the higher and lower values in a dataset.\r\n\nc.
    Mode: The value(s) that appear most frequently in a dataset.\r\n\r\n\n3. Measures
    of Variability:\r\n\nMeasures of variability provide information about the spread
    or dispersion of data points. Common measures include:\r"
