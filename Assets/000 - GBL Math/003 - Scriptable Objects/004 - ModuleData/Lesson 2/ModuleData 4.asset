  LeftPageText: "In this module, we explored different methods of data collection,
    including surveys, experiments, and observations. \n\nEach method has its advantages
    and limitations, and selecting the appropriate method depends on the research
    objective, available resources, and target population. \n\nUnderstanding these
    methods is essential for collecting high-quality data for statistical analysis.
    In the next module, we will delve into descriptive statistics and learn how to
    summarize and analyze data effectively."
