  LeftPageText: "Nominal Data: Nominal data consists of categories or labels with
    no inherent order. Examples include gender (male/female), colors (red/blue/green),
    or types of animals (dog/cat/horse).\r\n\r\nOrdinal Data: Ordinal data has categories
    with a specific order or ranking. For instance, a survey rating scale from \"very
    satisfied\" to \"very dissatisfied\" or education levels (elementary/high school/college).\r\n\r\nb.
    Numerical Data:\r\nNumerical data represents quantities and can be measured or
    counted. It can be further categorized into discrete and continuous data.\r"
  RightPageText: 'Discrete Data: Discrete data is counted and represents whole numbers
    or specific values. Examples include the number of siblings, the count of students
    in a class, or the number of cars passing through a toll booth.

    

    Continuous
    Data: Continuous data can take any value within a specific range. It is typically
    measured and includes variables like height, weight, temperature, or time.

    

    Understanding
    the type of data is essential as it guides us in choosing appropriate statistical
    methods and techniques for analysis.
