  RightPageText: "In this module, we explored the basics of statistics and learned
    about the two main types of data: categorical and numerical. Categorical data
    includes nominal and ordinal data, while numerical data consists of discrete
    and continuous data. \n\nUnderstanding these distinctions is essential for conducting
    proper data analysis and drawing meaningful conclusions. In the next module,
    we will delve deeper into data collection methods. Keep up the great work, and
    let's continue exploring the exciting world of statistics!"
